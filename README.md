# Neural Networks to find Invisible Higgs Decays at the LHC

Finding the Higgs boson was immensely challenging, but was achieved in 2012 by ATLAS and CMS at the LHC. Here the Higgs was discovered in its decays to 2 photons, and in the 4 lepton channel. 

Here we are targeting a much more difficult task - where the Higgs decays to "invisible" particles that are not detectable at the LHC. In the Standard Model, this decay can occur where the Higgs decays to 4 neutrinos. This is an extremely rare process in the Standard Model, with an expected branching ratio of only 0.1%.
